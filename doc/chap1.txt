  [33X[0;0Y[5XRAMEGA[105X  stands  for  ``RAndom  MEthods  in  Group ALgebras". This package is
  dedicated  to  realization of some standard functions for group rings by the
  means  of  the  random  methods.  This approach allows to compute the needed
  function in a reasonable time and with minimal memory use even for the large
  group rings [BR00].[133X

  [33X[0;0YChapter  [14X2[114X  describes  the  functions for group algebras which were obtained
  using the random methods.[133X

  [33X[0;0YTo  get  the  newest version of this [5XGAP[105X 4 package download the archive file
  [11Xthelma-x.x.tar.gz[111X  and  unpack it in a directory called [21X[11Xpkg[111X[121X, preferably (but
  not  necessarily)  in  the  [21X[11Xpkg[111X[121X  subdirectory of your [5XGAP[105X 4 installation. It
  creates a subdirectory called [21X[11XRAMEGA[111X[121X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  [5XRAMEGA[105X has no additional C libraries, there is no need in any additional
  installation steps.[133X

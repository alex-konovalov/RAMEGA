  [33X[0;0Y[5XRAMEGA[105X  stands  for  ``RAndom  MEthods  in  Group ALgebras". This package is
  dedicated  to  realization of some standard functions for group rings by the
  means  of  the  random  methods.  This approach allows to compute the needed
  function in a reasonable time and with minimal memory use even for the large
  group rings [BR00].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  main  purpose  of  [5XRAMEGA[105X  is  to deal with the group of units of group
  algebras,  in  particular, modular group algebras. In modular case the order
  of  group  of units is an exponenetial function of the order of basic group.
  Therefore  the  size  of  group  of units can be very large even for smaller
  basic  groups.  This  package contains random functions corresponding to the
  properties  of  group of units of group algebras. Most functions also can be
  found  in [5XLAGUNA[105X [BKRS17], but due to random methods, their computation time
  are significantly reduced in [5XRAMEGA[105X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XRAMEGA[105X  also  contains  functions related to Lie properties of group alebras
  and  there are some functions that work for any group structure not only for
  group algebras.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YOverview over this manual[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YChapter  [14X2[114X  describes  the  functions for group algebras which were obtained
  using  the random methods. There are three subchapters in it. The first one,
  [14X2.1[114X, describes some basic operations for group algebras, which don't involve
  randomness.  Chapter  [14X2.2[114X  describes  the methods, which return the elements
  with  some  desired  property  by  a  random way. Chapter [14X2.3[114X describes some
  general  methods  for  group  algebras. All the methods in this section also
  return the result by a random way.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YInstallation[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  get  the  newest version of this [5XGAP[105X 4 package download the archive file
  [11Xramega-x.x.tar.gz[111X  and  unpack it in a directory called [21X[11Xpkg[111X[121X, preferably (but
  not  necessarily)  in  the  [21X[11Xpkg[111X[121X  subdirectory of your [5XGAP[105X 4 installation. It
  creates a subdirectory called [21X[11XRAMEGA[111X[121X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  [5XRAMEGA[105X has no additional C libraries, there is no need in any additional
  installation steps.[133X

<Heading>Introduction</Heading>

<Package>Thelma</Package> stands for ``THreshold ELements, Modelling and Applications".
This package is dedicated to realization of Boolean functions by the means of the threshold elements and multilayered perceptrons.
Threshold elements were introduced in <Cite Key="McCulloch43a"/>. A certain number of articles on threshold logic appeared in 60-s and 70-s, however this field is regaining a considerable interest
nowadays as well (see <Cite Key="Horvath16"/>,<Cite Key="Horvath1994"/>, <Cite Key="Gowda11"/>, <Cite Key="Kulkarni16"/>, e.t.c). <P/>

We mostly refer to the methods proposed in <Cite Key="GecheBovdi80"/>, <Cite Key="GecheRobotyshyn83"/>, <Cite Key="GecheMulesa2017"/>, and <Cite Key="Dertouzos65"/>.


<Section Label="overview">
<Heading>Overview over this manual</Heading>
Chapter <Ref Chap="thr_elements"/> describes the functions operating with the threshold elements.
They include the basic operations, the functions that verify the realizability of a given Boolean function by a single threshold element, and some iterative methods.
Chapter <Ref Chap="thr_networks"/> describes the functions for neural networks, built from the threshold elements.

<Heading>Installation</Heading>
To get the newest version of this &GAP; 4 package download one of the
archive files
<List>
<Item> <F>thelma-x.x.tar.gz</F> </Item>
<Item> <F>thelma-x.x.tar.bz2</F> </Item>
<Item> <F>thelma-x.x.zip</F> </Item>
</List>
and unpack it using
<Verb>
gunzip thelma-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf thelma-x.x.tar
</Verb>
or
<Verb>
bzip2 -d thelma-x.x.tar.bz2; tar xvf thelma-x.x.tar
</Verb>
or
<Verb>
unzip -x thelma-x.x.zip
</Verb>
respectively.
<P/>

Do this in a directory called <Q><F>pkg</F></Q>, preferably (but not
necessarily) in the <Q><F>pkg</F></Q> subdirectory of your &GAP; 4
installation. It creates a subdirectory called <Q><F>thelma</F></Q>.<P/>

As <Package>Thelma</Package> has no additional C libraries, there is no need in any additional installation steps.<P/>

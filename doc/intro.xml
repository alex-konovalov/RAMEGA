<Package>RAMEGA</Package> stands for ``RAndom MEthods in Group ALgebras".
This package is dedicated to realization of some standard functions for group rings by the means of the random methods. This approach allows to compute the needed function
in a reasonable time and with minimal memory use even for the large group rings <Cite Key="Bovdi_Rosa_I"/>.

<Section Label="overview">
<Heading>Overview over this manual</Heading>
Chapter <Ref Chap="random"/> describes the functions for group algebras which were obtained using the random methods.

<Heading>Installation</Heading>
To get the newest version of this &GAP; 4 package download the
archive file <F>thelma-x.x.tar.gz</F> and unpack it in a directory called <Q><F>pkg</F></Q>, preferably (but not
necessarily) in the <Q><F>pkg</F></Q> subdirectory of your &GAP; 4
installation. It creates a subdirectory called <Q><F>RAMEGA</F></Q>.<P/>

As <Package>RAMEGA</Package> has no additional C libraries, there is no need in any additional installation steps.<P/>
